The three target values to you to predict are: target_carbon_monoxide, target_benzene, and target_nitrogen_oxides

train.csv - the training data, including the weather data, sensor data, and values for the 3 targets

test.csv - the same format as train.csv, but without the target value; your task is to predict the value for each of these targets.
